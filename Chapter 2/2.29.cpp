// Using the techniques of this chapter, write a program that calculates the squares and cubes of the integers from 0 to 10.
// Use tabs to print the following neatly formatted table of values:




#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
    cout << "integer\t" << "square\t" << "cube\n";


    cout << 0 << "\t" << 0*0 << "\t" << 0*0*0 << "\n";
    cout << 1 << "\t" << 1*1 << "\t" << 1*1*1 << "\n";
    cout << 2 << "\t" << 2*2 << "\t" << 2*2*2 << "\n";
    cout << 3 << "\t" << 3*3 << "\t" << 3*3*3 << "\n";
    cout << 4 << "\t" << 4*4 << "\t" << 4*4*4 << "\n";
    cout << 5 << "\t" << 5*5 << "\t" << 5*5*5 << "\n";
    cout << 6 << "\t" << 6*6 << "\t" << 6*6*6 << "\n";
    cout << 7 << "\t" << 7*7 << "\t" << 7*7*7 << "\n";
    cout << 8 << "\t" << 8*8 << "\t" << 8*8*8 << "\n";
    cout << 9 << "\t" << 9*9 << "\t" << 9*9*9 << "\n";
    cout << 10 << "\t" << 10*10 << "\t" << 10*10*10 << "\n";
