# CppHowToProgram-ExerciseSolutions
This repository contains model answers and solutions to exercises from the book *C++ How to Program* by Deitel. The exercises are organized by chapter and will be updated incrementally as I progress through the book. These solutions demonstrate problem-solving techniques and effective programming practices in C++.


## Progress

- **Chapter 1**: Completed
- **Chapter 2**: Completed
- **Chapter 3**: In Progress

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a chapter of the book. Inside each chapter folder, you will find individual C++ source files corresponding to the exercises from that chapter.

## Detailed Comments and Notes

In each code file, I've included my own comments, which contain specific notes and insights that you may find beneficial. These notes include:
- **Problems Encountered**: Challenges and issues I faced while implementing the solutions, along with how I resolved them.
- **Key Takeaways**: Important aspects of the code that you should pay attention to, including tips and best practices.

These comments are designed to provide additional context and help you understand the thought process behind each solution.

## How to Use

You can browse the repository by chapter to see the solutions for specific exercises. Each C++ file contains comments and explanations to make the code easier to understand.

To run the code, you can compile the `.cpp` files using a C++ compiler like `g++`. For example:

```bash
g++ Chapter1/exercise1.cpp -o exercise1
./exercise1
